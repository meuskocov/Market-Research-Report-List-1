<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultraviolet Filters in Personal Care Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Organic UV Filters</li><li>Inorganic UV Filters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ultraviolet (UV) filters in the personal care market are categorized into two main types: organic and inorganic UV filters. Organic UV filters, often derived from carbon-based compounds, absorb UV radiation and convert it into heat, which is then released from the skin. In contrast, inorganic UV filters, such as zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, act as physical blockers that reflect and scatter UV rays away from the skin. Both types are used in sunscreens and cosmetic products to protect against skin damage.</p></p>
